# 1. Early Efforts

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png>)

Working in the terminal on Linux and macOS is comfortable enough for me. I've spent time focused on learning the general structure of commands, reading man pages, and creating scripts. Primarily this has been focused device discovery, mapping network footprints, and other efforts related to Cyber Security.

Changing focus a little bit I have learned to use cardano-cli, cardano-wallet, and other tools to perform tasks related to navigating on Cardano. This includes:

* Running a node
* Querying the blockchain
* Creating key pairs and addresses
* Creating full wallets
* Creating and sending transactions

However, I made an effort to understand more about working with Cardano native assets. This is initially to better understand the mechanics of them and later to be able to relate the actions required for corresponding programs built for those purposes.

Ultimately, the goal is to be able to establish, deploy, and run various projects on Cardano suitable for both recreational and enterprise use cases. The idea of enterprise NFTs and smart contracts fascinate me. I can see great future utility in how NFTs both serve as proof of ownership (for digital, real, or intellectual property) and for how they can better facilitate certain elements in business operations.&#x20;

For now, I'm simply recording my journey through the process and declaring a proof of knowledge along the way.

### Minting a Native Token

The first task was to create a native token. This first one that I created is simple in nature and is not monetized.&#x20;

I created the ViralNinja tokens with a single address for minting, and with essentially the minimum required monetary policy.

Token name: ViralNinja

Amount Minted: 10 million

Minting policy: locked shortly after minting

#### Proof of Minting

The transaction hash for minting is:

[632187ebe1ad6c41dfb63c11a811a947fb84e698a03f2690aa732f783295584a](https://testnet.cardanoscan.io/transaction/632187ebe1ad6c41dfb63c11a811a947fb84e698a03f2690aa732f783295584a)

As expected, the transaction fee for minting was 0.18 ₳ (or approximately 9 cents at the time of transaction).

The process was simple enough with no real complications and I feel like it's easily reproducible.&#x20;

Future efforts: I would like to explore the monetary policy in more detail to see what more can be done with it.

### First Real NFT

The first real batch of NFTs that I made were selected from mathematically generated images that I had already created with a python program of mine. I say real test, because I did generate a single NFT first a while back, but it was of poor quality. Although it did expose me to the process.&#x20;

I selected three images for this test and built metadata JSON files for them. Overall, again, the process was fairly simple with no real surprises. All of this was handled in the terminal, and there were only some areas where I had to research alternative methods for what I was trying to do with the NFT minting process.

I found the NFT metadata template standards found in [CIP-25](https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip25/) to be helpful and generally used them as a standard. I didn't included the declaration of Version 1.0 and so far this doesn't seem to have made a difference. I suppose with the Vasil HF and future CIPs amending or adding to metadata this might be more important. And if for nothing other than completeness in the JSON file I might add it.

NFT Names: Rough NFT 1, 2, 3

Minted in this transaction: 3

Policy: Locked after 10,000 slots from the minting transaction

The errors that I made here are:

1. I did not properly scrub the metadata file I used for my first super early test and technically wound up with the NFT name of "Tiger". This was not intended.
2. I foolishly tried to add all three metadata files to the transaction under the impression that the blockchain would be able to determine which asset name corresponded to which JSON file. This was inaccurate and I have learned from my mistake (more in the second NFT minting). Instead, all three NFTs possess only the first metadata from the Rough NFT 1.

```
{ 1146f07a9777f5ca323ce2bc478f733721d15804573ff91291c247ab: { 
Tiger: { 
id: "1", 
name: "Rought NFT 1", 
image: "ipfs://QmfD12nQq4Q5vx3cBA1jXDimikCvVNZn2Aro8UbfgUwgzH", 
description: "Rough NFT 1" 
    } 
  } 
}
```

The transaction fee for minting three NFTs was 0.18 ₳ (or approximately 9 cents at the time of transaction), so minting multiple NFTs together can considerably reduce your per-NFT costs.

Not to undersell my lesson here, I did gain both confidence and understanding of the NFT minting process. There were a few snags with building the transaction and getting the elements correct, but ultimately I was able to submit the minting transaction just fine and the blockchain accepted it. Go Tigers!

#### Proof of Minting

The transaction hash for minting is:

[1146f07a9777f5ca323ce2bc478f733721d15804573ff91291c247ab](https://testnet.cardanoscan.io/tokenPolicy/1146f07a9777f5ca323ce2bc478f733721d15804573ff91291c247ab)

### Second NFT Minting (with Royalty)

After successfully (in a manner of degrees) minting the first three NFTs I then set about to set a Royalty token with the NFT policy. This is one of the key elements that I wanted to test. I read and understood the [CIP-27](https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip27/) community standard for Royalty Tokens and wanted to put this into effect. To me, it's clear that many NFT projects will desire or require this functionality so it's an important one to get correct.

Token Names: Rough NFT 7, 8

Number Minted: 2

Policy: Locked after 2+ million slots after the transaction (roughly 30 days)

Royalty Set: 20%

Disclaimer: I realize that 20% royalty is not realistic but I did this more for the test of the token.

I will admit I had more apprehension about the concept of submitting a transaction for an "unnamed token" than I should have. But, this was my first time.

I had to do quite a bit of research to figure out how I define no name for a token with a policy ID. No real useful information or examples existed that I could find in a day, so I went with the most logical thing in my instincts.

I sent the policy ID and token name as "$PolicyID." In other words, I just left the token name literally blank. Turns out that's what you're supposed to do. So, if anyone else types a search for something like "how to build an unnamed token for royalties" in the search bar, hopefully it brings you here.

I submitted the first token with the 777 tag as in the standard and just a single address for the payout. It was accepted just fine.

```
{
   addr: "addr_test1vrv70hdddtknrzeqjhzr7jlmttplyx9562vks4ulpqqwu2gfv74k8",
   rate: "0.2"
}
```

I then immediately burned the token as recommended. This process was fairly straight forward. Essentially I just resubmit a mint transaction while the policy is still open, but I input 1 of the unnamed token and returned -1. This effectively burns the token and preserves UTxO space.

After this, I minted the two NFTs planned for this test. This time I learned from the first real multiple NFT minting process and combined the metadata JSON files appropriately.&#x20;

I learned that if multiple NFTs are being minted together a clear way to assign the correct metadata is to build it all in one JSON file. If the NFTs are minted on-demand then the JSON can be created just for that one NFT just fine.

The transaction fee for minting two NFTs was 0.18 ₳ (or approximately 9 cents at the time of transaction), again proving that minting multiple NFTs together considerably reduces costs.

#### Proof of Minting

The transaction hash for the minting is:

[eca56a05f792154bd97bc6e9237af45340c58acec8c7520917e47101](https://testnet.cardanoscan.io/tokenPolicy/eca56a05f792154bd97bc6e9237af45340c58acec8c7520917e47101)

Additionally, the transaction information for minting and burning the royalty token is:

{% embed url="https://testnet.cardanoscan.io/token/eca56a05f792154bd97bc6e9237af45340c58acec8c7520917e47101?tab=minttransactions" %}
Rough NFT Royalty Token Minting and Burning
{% endembed %}

Future plans include writing a Royalty Token pointing to a Plutus smart contract that directs the payments to two ADAhandle NFTs. I really wish this could be done just in the simple 777 standard (that is, pointing to an ADAhandle) but it doesn't appear that the blockchain will query the ADAhandle resolver on its own.
