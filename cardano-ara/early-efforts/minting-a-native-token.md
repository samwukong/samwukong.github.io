# Minting a Native Token

The first task was to create a native token. This first one that I created is simple in nature and is not monetized.&#x20;

I created the ViralNinja tokens with a single address for minting, and with essentially the minimum required monetary policy.

Token name: ViralNinja

Amount Minted: 10 million

Minting policy: locked shortly after minting

#### Proof of Minting

The transaction hash for minting is:

[632187ebe1ad6c41dfb63c11a811a947fb84e698a03f2690aa732f783295584a](https://testnet.cardanoscan.io/transaction/632187ebe1ad6c41dfb63c11a811a947fb84e698a03f2690aa732f783295584a)

As expected, the transaction fee for minting was 0.18 â‚³ (or approximately 9 cents at the time of transaction).

The process was simple enough with no real complications and I feel like it's easily reproducible.&#x20;

Future efforts: I would like to explore the monetary policy in more detail to see what more can be done with it.
