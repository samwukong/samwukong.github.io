**Song** **of Myself**
======================

_By Walt Whitman_

  

Alone, far in the wilds and mountains, I hunt,

Wandering, amazed at my own lightness and glee;

In the late afternoon choosing a safe spot to pass the night,

Kindling a fire and broiling the fresh-kill’d game;

Falling asleep on the gather’d leaves, with my dog and gun by my side.
